My bachelor thesis project:

A travel app that allows you to calculate routes using google maps, by stating start-, end- and optional waypoints. On the basis of these points you can search for sights and events close to them and also get automated recommendations in different categories. These queries are handled by Gemini AI to give you current results. The project was meant to test the abilites of AI and its relevance for real life applications on a small scale.

The project is not completely finished and also not viable for commercial purposes due to missing licences for the Gemini API.
